# Start Scraping with Python

This repository uses LXML to scrape webpages. [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is an awesome package, but for those who want fine-grain control of the pages they scrape, LXML is what runs underneath the hood in Beautiful Soup.

That said, we're going to start with the basics, and add info as requested by users.

### Future additions

- [ ] Build Development environment
- [ ] How to scrape pages that use JavaScript
